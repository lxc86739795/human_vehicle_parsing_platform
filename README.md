# parsing_platform
A pytorch codebase for human parsing and vehicle parsing.

## Introduction
A pytorch codebase for human parsing and vehicle parsing. The introduction of our new MVP dataset for vehicle parsing can be found [HERE](https://xinchenliu.com/MVP.html).

## Requirements

- Linux or macOS with python â‰¥ 3.6
- PyTorch = 0.4.1
- torchvision that matches the Pytorch installation. You can install them together at [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/) to make sure of this.
- tensorboard (needed for visualization): `pip install tensorboard`

## Supported methods

- [x] PSPNet
- [x] DeepLabV3
- [x] CCNet
- [x] DANet
- [x] OCNet
- [x] CE2P
- [x] HRNet
- [x] BraidNet


## Supported datasets

- [x] Look-Into-Person [LIP](http://sysu-hcp.net/lip/)
- [x] Multi-grained Vehicle Parsing [MVP](https://xinchenliu.com/MVP.html)

## Train and Test

The scripts to train and test models are in `train_test`.
The scripts for PSPNet, DeepLabV3, and HRNet are ready for directly running.
The train/val/test splitting files used in our experiments can be found [here](https://github.com/lxc86739795/human_vehicle_parsing_platform/blob/main/split.zip).

## Model Zoo

**Models trained on the MVP dataset for vehicle parsing**:

| Method | Dataset | Pixel Acc | Mean Acc | mIoU | download |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |:---: | :---: |:---: |
| PSPNet | MVP-Coarse | 90.26% | 89.08% | 79.78% | [model](https://github.com/lxc86739795/parsing_platform/releases/download/v0.1/pspnet_mvp_coarse.pth) |
| PSPNet | MVP-Fine | 86.21% | 69.61% | 57.47% | [model](https://github.com/lxc86739795/parsing_platform/releases/download/v0.1/pspnet_mvp_fine.pth) |
| DeepLabV3 | MVP-Coarse | 90.55% | 89.45% | 80.04% | [model](https://github.com/lxc86739795/parsing_platform/releases/download/v0.1/deeplabv3_mvp_coarse.pth) |
| DeepLabV3 | MVP-Fine | 87.42% | 73.50% | 61.60% | [model](https://github.com/lxc86739795/parsing_platform/releases/download/v0.1/deeplabv3_mvp_fine.pth) |
| HRNet | MVP-Coarse | 90.40% | 89.36% | 80.04% | [model](https://github.com/lxc86739795/parsing_platform/releases/download/v0.1/hrnet_mvp_coarse.pth) |
| HRNet | MVP-Fine | 86.47% | 72.62% | 60.21% | [model](https://github.com/lxc86739795/parsing_platform/releases/download/v0.1/hrnet_mvp_fine.pth) |

\* The performance is evaluated on the test set.

\** The PSPNet and HRNet models are trained with cross-entropy loss. The DeepLabV3 models are trained with cross-entropy + IoU loss.
